# Integrated Width

Initial script that calculates an integrated valley segment width.
 - Starts with a single geopackage containing two layers:
 - polyline named centerline
 - segmented polygons

Just run the script, and it will give you two file dialogs:
 - first one asks for the input geopackage
 - second one is asking for an output directory
